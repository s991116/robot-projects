Git:
Remember Git password, when pushing changes to google.code

run the cmd type this:
setx HOME %USERPROFILE% 
and the %HOME% will be set to 'C:\Users\"username"'

then go to it and make a file called '_netrc'
Note: for Windows, you need a '_netrc' file, not a '.netrc'.

Its content is quite standard (Replace the with your values):

machine code.google.com 
login philip.juhl@gmail.com 
password <Google generated>
